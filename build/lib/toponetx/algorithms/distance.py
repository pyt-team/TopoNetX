def distance(complex: Complex, source: Hashable, target: Hashable, s: int = 1) -> int:
    """Return shortest s-walk distance between two nodes in the cell complex.

    Parameters
    ----------
    complex : Complex.
        Supported complexes are cell/combintorial and hypegraphs.
    source : Hashable
        A node in the input complex.
    target : Hashable
        A node in the input complex.
    s : int, optional
        The number of intersections between pairwise consecutive cells.

    Returns
    -------
    s_walk_distance : int

    --------
    cell_distance

    Notes
    -----
    The s-distance is the shortest s-walk length between the nodes.
    An s-walk between nodes is a sequence of nodes that pairwise share
    at least s cells. The length of the shortest s-walk is 1 less than
    the number of nodes in the path sequence.

    Uses the networkx shortest_path_length method on the graph
    generated by the s-adjacency matrix.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> CC = CellComplex()
    >>> CC.add_cell([2,3,4],rank=2)
    >>> CC.add_cell([5,6,7],rank=2)
    >>> list(node_diameters(CC))

    >>> list(node_diameters(CCC))

    Parameters
    ----------

    -------
    int
        Shortest s-walk cell distance between `source` and `target`.
        A shortest s-walk is computed as a sequence of cells,
        the s-walk distance is the number of cells in the sequence
