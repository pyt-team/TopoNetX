class Path(Atom[tuple[Hashable]]):
    """Path class.

    A class representing an elementary p-path in a path complex, which is the building block for a path complex. By the definition established
    in the original paper [2]_, an elementary p-path on a non-empty set of vertices V is any sequence of vertices
    with length p + 1.

    Unlike the original paper [2]_ where elementary p-paths span the regular space of boundary-invariant paths,
    the elementary p-paths represented by this class span the space of simple paths with length p as proposed in [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    elements : Sequence[Hashable]
        The nodes in the elementary p-path.
    construct_boundaries : bool, default=False
        If True, construct the entire boundary of the elementary p-path.
    reserve_sequence_order : bool, default=False
        If True, reserve the order of the sub-sequence of nodes in the elementary p-path.
        Else, the sub-sequence of nodes in the elementary p-path will be reversed if the first index is larger than the last index.
    allowed_paths : Iterable[tuple[Hashable]], optional
        A list of allowed boundaries of an elementary p-path. If None, all possible boundaries are constructed (similarly to simplex).
    **kwargs : keyword arguments, optional
        Additional attributes to be associated with the elementary p-path.

    Notes
    -----
    - An elementary p-path is defined as an ordered sequence of nodes (n1, ..., np) if we reserve the sequence order. Thus, for this case, (n1, ..., np) is different
    from (np, ..., n1). If we do not reserve the sequence order, then (n1, ..., np) is the same as (np, ..., n1). For this case, the first index must be smaller
    than the last index so that we can discard the other duplicate elementary p-path. As elementary p-paths may contain characters and numbers at the same time, we leverage
    lexicographical order to compare two indices.
    - Similarly to simplex, in order to find the boundary of an elementary p-path, we remove one node at a time from the elementary p-path. However, unlike simplex
    where order does not matter, the process of omitting nodes from an elementary p-path may result some non-existing paths. For instance, if we have an elementary
    p-path (1, 2, 3) and there is no path (1, 3), then applying boundary operation on the elementary p-path results in [(2,3), (1,3), (1,2)]. In order to avoid this,
    we can provide a list of allowed boundaries. If the boundary of an elementary p-path is not in the list of allowed boundaries,
    then it will not be included in the boundary of the elementary p-path.
    - When an elementary p-path is created and allowed paths are not specified, its boundary is automatically created by iteratively removing one node at a time
    from the elementary p-path, which is identical to a simplex.

        Notes
        -----
        - In order to construct a set of boundary (p-1)-paths of an elementary p-path (n1, ..., np), we iteratively omit one node at a time from
        the elementary p-path. The resulted boundary paths are elementary (p-1)-paths in the form of (n1, ..., ni-1, ni+1, ..., np), where i is
        the index of the omitted node. However, some of the elementary (p-1)-paths may be non-existing (or non-allowed in our context), so we
        discard them from the boundary set.
