"""Load Austin R. Benson's datasets.

This module provides functions to load the datasets by Austin R. Benson, published on
his website:

    https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/

A dataset is stored in a folder with the following mandatory files:

- ``{name}-nverts.txt``: Line ``i`` contains the number of vertices in the ``i``-th simplex.

- ``{name}-simplices.txt``: Each line contains a vertex ID. Line 1 corresponds to the
  first vertex of the first simplex, line 2 to the second vertex of the first simplex,
  and so on.

Optionally, additional files can be present and are consumed by the functions in this
module:

- ``{name}-times.txt``: Line ``i`` contains the timestamp of the ``i``-th simplex.
