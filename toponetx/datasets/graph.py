    Parameters
    ----------
    complex_type : {'simplicial','cell'}
        The type of complex to load.
    feat_dim : int, default=2
        The number of eigenvectors to be attached to the simplices/cells
        of the output complex.

    Returns
    -------
    When input is "simplicial":
           a SimplicialComplex obtained from karate club graph by lifting the graph to its clique complex.
           The simplicial complex comes with the following features
        "node_feat":
            - its value is the first feat_dim Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors attached to nodes.
        "edge_feat":
            - its value is the first feat_dim Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors attached to edges.
        "face_feat":
            - its value is the first feat_dim Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors attached to faces.
        "tetrahedron_feat": the first feat_dim Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors attached to tetrahedron.
    When input is "cell":
            a CellComplex obtained from karate club by lifting the graph to a cell obtained obtained
            from the graph by adding the independent homology cycles in the graph.
            The cell complex comes with the following features
        "node_feat":
            - its value is the first feat_dim Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors attached to nodes.
        "edge_feat":
            - its value is the first feat_dim Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors attached to edges.
        "cell_feat":
            - its value is the first feat_dim Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors attached to cells.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If complex_type is not one of the supported values.

    Note
    -----
    A featured simplicial complex is returned as the clique complex of the graph.
    A featured cell complex is returned as the cell complex obtained by adding the
    independent cycles of graph.

    """Load the coauthorship network from [SNN20] as a simplicial complex.

    The coauthorship network is a simplicial complex where a paper with k authors is represented by a (k-1)-simplex.
    The dataset is pre-processed as in [SNN20]. From the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus 80 papers with number of citations between 5 and 10 were sampled.
    The papers constitute simplices in the complex, which is completed with subsimplices (seen as collaborations between subsets of authors) to form a simplicial complex.
    An attribute named "citations" is added to each simplex, corresponding to the sum of citations of all papers on which the authors represented by the simplex collaborated.
    The resulting simplicial complex is of dimension 10 and contains 24552 simplices in total. See [SNN20] for a more detailed description of the dataset.
