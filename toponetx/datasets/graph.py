    Parameters
    ----------
    complex_type : {'simplicial','cell'}, default='simplicial'
        The type of complex to loaded.
    feat_dim : int, default=2
        The number of eigenvectors to be attached to the simplices/cells
        of the output complex.

    Returns
    -------
    When input is "simplicial":
           a SimplicialComplex obtained from karate club with the following features
        "node_feat":
            - its value is the first feat_dim Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors attached to nodes.
        "edge_feat":
            - its value is the first feat_dim Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors attached to edges.
        "face_feat":
            - its value is the first feat_dim Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors attached to faces.
        "tetrahedron_feat": the first feat_dim Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors attached to tetrahedron.
    When input is "cell":
            a CellComplex obtained from karate club with the following features
        "node_feat":
            - its value is the first feat_dim Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors attached to nodes.
        "edge_feat":
            - its value is the first feat_dim Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors attached to edges.
        "cell_feat":
            - its value is the first feat_dim Hodge Laplacian eigenvectors attached to cells.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If complex_type is not one of the supported values.

    Note
    -----
    A featured simplicial complex is returned as the clique complex of the graph.
    A featured cell complex is returned as the cell complex obtained by adding the
    independent cycles of graph.
