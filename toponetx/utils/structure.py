"""Utilities on structures.

The first function, sparse_array_to_neighborhood_list, takes a sparse array
representing a higher order structure between two sets of
cells, S and T, and converts it to a neighborhood list. This
is a list of tuples such that each tuple has the form (s, t),
where s and t are indices representing cells in S and T.
The function also allows for optional dictionaries that map
 the indices in S and T to other values.

The second function, neighborhood_list_to_neighborhood_dict,
takes a neighborhood list and converts it to a neighborhood dictionary.
This dictionary maps each cell i in S to a list of cells j that are in
the neighborhood of i.

The third function, sparse_array_to_neighborhood_dict,
combines the first two functions and takes a sparse array as
input and returns a neighborhood dictionary. It first converts
the sparse array to a neighborhood list, and then converts the
neighborhood list to a neighborhood dictionary. Like the first
function, it also allows for optional dictionaries that map the
indices in S and T to other values.
